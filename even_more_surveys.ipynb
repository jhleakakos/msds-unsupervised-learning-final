    "## Survey and Survey Data Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "I started this project by looking at candidate datasets. I came across the mental health dataset at https://data.gov, I figured that data would be relatively straightforward to work with. Little did I know how just much complexity goes into surveys, survey data, and Census data. I will summarize what I learned about how the specific survey we look at in this project as well as how surveys similar to the one in this project work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: much of my summary in this section comes from the main Household Pulse Survey link cited above as well as this sub-page: https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The United Stated Census Bureau is a primary hub for data about the American citizenry and economy. Before digging into this project, I was aware of the United States Census that happens every ten years. Beyond the official United States Census, I actually did not know what else the Census Bureau gathered, though I was aware that it was involved in other data work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Census Bureau started the Household Pulse Survey (HPS) in 2020 in partnership with other federal agencies and to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HPS gathers data about American households in a much faster timeframe than other surveys available at the time. The HPS originally surveyed respondents weekly. This then changed to bi-weekly and eventually monthly. The HPS gathers and releases data in phases that typically run for around nine weeks with multiple collections during phases. From my research, this is a very fast turnaround time for surveys and survey data. One result of that is that representation among survey respondents becomes more difficult. We will speak about that more in the weighting section below. But, in general, it looks like the HPS has a gathering and reporting cycle that is pretty fast compared to many other common surveys that I looked into.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HPS allows analysis at the national level, state level, and scoped to the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). You can find more information about MSAs at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro.html, but my colloquial summary for them is areas of high population density and certain characteristics that make them population and economic hubs in their respective regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HPS is a 20-minute survey that asks about demographic characteristics as well as a number of relevant topics such as:\n",
    "- Childcare arrangements\n",
    "- Food sufficiency\n",
    "- Housing security\n",
    "- Household spending\n",
    "- Physical and mental health\n",
    "- Health insurance coverage\n",
    "- Social isolation\n",
    "- (You can see a more complete list of topics at https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html in the section titled **What information does the Household Pulse Survey collect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of what the HPS is looking to study is robust, and the topics are relevant to areas where people were struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic and are continuing to struggle now.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will focus on earlier surveys when the HPS started in 2020. The HPS continues today and has expanded in scope over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk more about this below, but the general approach in this project will be to explore clustering, anomaly/outlier detection, and feature reduction. Each of these prefer or require disaggregated data. This means we will work with the HPS Public Use Files (PUF) instead of data tables. PUFs have respondent-level data. The Census Bureau provides data tables with re-weighting and aggregation already done so that researchers can focus on trends and findings instead of working on the disaggregated data, so those are available if of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick summary of my current understanding of surveys, Census Bureau data, and the HPS. It took a lot of research to get to this level of understanding. I call this out because there is one more aspect of the HPS data that has been even more difficult to make sense of and to determine how to incorporate into this project: weighting."
